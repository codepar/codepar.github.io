Not much to see here


(note to self) - bunch of newsletter code was commented to force newsletter to stop rendering since the audience/list in mailchimp is being used for sth else now (i.e. the code here is good, I was just being lazy and forced the rendering to stop instead of modifying the list valies in mailchimp)
